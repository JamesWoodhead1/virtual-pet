Virtual Pet
This project will create virtual pet with a lifespan of 30 days
The virtual pet will also require feeding and exercising
The virtual pet will also die if you do not look after it properly!

This Project included the use of TDD with frequent uploads to GitHub
This project used Jest as part of my TDD to ensure the functions I was writing were correct.
I used Node in order to create and also test run the project, as further testing that everything was working as intended.
